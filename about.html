        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>I was born in Raleigh, North Carolina, and have lived here my entire life. I have graduated high school at East Wake High School, and am currently enrolled at Wake Technical Community College.</p>
		<br> 
		<p>I have spent much of my time working for family members, in particular with my uncles doing technical support for a towing company, as well as a construction company. I have also been employed in the food industry as a pizza delivery driver. </p></p>
